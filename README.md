## 📱 Bazaaro
Bazaaro is a location-based marketplace mobile application built with React Native. It helps users instantly discover nearby local stores that have the exact products they're searching for — saving time, effort, and uncertainty.

🔍 What It Does
Search for Items: Users type in what they need, and Bazaaro finds local stores that have it in stock.

Get Offers: Nearby stores respond with real-time offers — including prices, availability, and store ratings.

Find & Go: Users can compare offers, select the best one, and get instant directions to the store.

⚛️ Frontend Tech Stack
React Native for cross-platform mobile development (Android & iOS)

React Navigation for screen and stack management

Context API or Redux (if applicable) for state management

Google Maps SDK / MapView for store location and directions

Custom UI components built for smooth, responsive UX

Bazaaro is currently a frontend-only implementation focused on user interface, interactions, and smooth navigation. Backend services (like store responses and real-time data) are mocked or will be integrated in future phases.
